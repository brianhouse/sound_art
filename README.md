# ARHA 292: SOUND ART

Monday / Wednesday 1:00–3:00  
Fayerweather 215  

Prof. Brian House (he/him)  
[bhouse@amherst.edu](mailto:bhouse@amherst.edu)  
Office hours Tuesday 11:00–11:45  
Fayerweather 306


## Course Description
This course explores sound as a medium of art-making with a rich history and radical potential within contemporary culture. Techniques covered will include non-musical scores, field recording, basic computer-based audio manipulation, and building lo-fi electronics for experimental sound synthesis. Accompanying readings draw from acoustic ecology, critical sound studies, afro-futurism, and media theory to contextualize collective exploration. Students will be expected to create studio-based art for critique. No musical experience is required.


#### Objectives
- Incorporate sound and listening into studio practice
- Gain proficiency with audio recording, editing, and real-time synthesis technology and techniques
- Survey contemporary artists working with sound as a medium
- Consider contemporary culture through sound-based epistemologies


## Assignments and Grading

### Projects
This course is built around four projects completed over the course of the semester and which will be [critiqued by the class](https://github.com/brianhouse/sound_art/blob/main/resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to be experimental and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. A title and [3-sentence statement](https://github.com/brianhouse/sound_art/blob/main/resources/statement_guidelines.md) must be included with each project. Cumulatively, the projects account for 50% of your final grade, with the final project given double weight. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.

### Exercises
Exercises are short assignments to help you get a handle on new techniques. In most cases, they are due for the class session following the one in which they are introduced. Cumulatively, they make up 15% of your final grade.

### Presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an influential work of sound art. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show the piece, analyze it, and discuss its influence. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPhcVVAViKSFwn7ufwh85ftbyqVCAH1wuNkG5fgo7ps/edit#gid=0) on a work chosen from [a list](https://github.com/brianhouse/sound_art/blob/main/resources/sound_artworks.md) on a first-come, first-served basis (you may present on an artist not from the list with prior approval). This presentation is 10% of your final grade.

### Reading
Most classes will include discussion of short texts that address conceptual issues in sound art. You are required to read them before class and have questions and comments ready. Posting a short response (1-3 sentences) online before class begins will be worth 10% of your final grade (asking a question about something you didn't understand is an excellent use of a post).

### Participation
Motivated and mindful participation in crit and classroom disscussion is expected and constitutes 15% of your final grade. Attendance is mandatory, and missed classes or late arrivals will impact your participation grade at the professor's discretion. 


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Laptop Use
This course requires a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, you will need to make arrangements to borrow one for the course.

<!-- ### Open Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours.
 -->
### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and produced by you. Sampling audio is an inherent part of sound art, and learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming. However, you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' work wholesale. Always credit your sources and inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways it capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
