## Course Description
This course explores sound as a medium of art-making with a rich history and radical potential within contemporary culture. Techniques covered will include listening exercises and non-musical scores, creative manipulation of analog media, and building lo-fi electronics. Accompanying readings draw from acoustic ecology, critical sound studies, and media theory to contextualize collective exploration. Students will be expected to create studio-based art for critique. No musical experience is required.

#### Objectives
- Incorporate sound and listening into studio practice
- Gain proficiency with various forms of audio media and electronics
- Survey contemporary artists working with sound as a medium
- Consider contemporary culture through sound-based epistemologies


## Assignments and Grading

### Workshops
Over the course of the semester, there will be many hands-on workshops in class. These workshops provide a material understanding of the subject matter and establish the technical skills that you will apply to your projects.

### Exercises
Most workshops conclude with exercise to be done as homework. You will present these exercises to the class in the following class session, but they will not be critiqued. Your attention should be on technical experimentation and development rather than demonstrating a particular concept. Audio exercises will need to be turned in via Moodle; physical objects must be brought to the classroom as well as video documentation uploaded to Moodle. No late exercises will be accepted.

### Projects
You will complete three larger projects over the course of the semester, each of which will use a different technical approach as developed in the workshops and exercises. These projects must have a strong conceptual component as informed by the readings and artistic examples discussed in class. These projects will be [critiqued by the class](https://github.com/brianhouse/sound_art/blob/master/resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to experiment and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. All projects must be well documented. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.

### Presentations
Over the course of the semester, each student will give **TWO** 10-minute presentations on an influential work of sound art as listed in the syllabus. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show the piece, analyze it, and discuss its influence. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPhcVVAViKSFwn7ufwh85ftbyqVCAH1wuNkG5fgo7ps/edit) on an artwork on a first-come, first-served basis. Slides should be turned in on Moodle prior to class.

### Reading
Many classes will include discussion of short texts that address conceptual issues in sound art. You are required to read them before class and have questions and comments ready—post these on Moodle ahead of the class session. 
<!-- Students [sign up to lead discussion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tlg_v_iKP1pUb0vhjd9k6T_N85KkhZCBdcLLTwvjz1g/edit) once over the course of the semester. -->

### Participation
Attending all class sessions is mandatory, and motivated and mindful participation in crit and classroom discussion is expected.

### Grading
In this course, you are expected to earnestly engage in the practice of studio artmaking, and doing so is the basis of your grade at the discretion of the professor. In other words, your grade is about process, not about product. If you use the assignments and class sessions as opportunities to practice studio _practice_, you will be fine. You will get feedback via peer critique, which you are expected to take into account in your future work. Midway through the semester, students will meet individually with the professor to track their progress.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Access to 303
While all students must complete their own work, you are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours. We will choose designated open studio hours in the first week. Keys to 303 will be distributed to all students after Add/Drop.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Technology
This course requires a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, you will need to make arrangements to borrow one for the course. It is expected that you will not use your laptop for other purposes while in class. The use of phones in class is not permitted.

### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and produced by you. Sampling audio is an inherent part of sound art, and learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming. However, you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' work wholesale. Always credit your sources and inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways it capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
