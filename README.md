Office hours by appointment


## Course Description
This course explores sound as a medium of art-making with a rich history and radical potential within contemporary culture. Techniques covered will include non-musical scores, field recording, basic computer-based audio manipulation, and building lo-fi electronics for experimental sound synthesis. Accompanying readings draw from acoustic ecology, critical sound studies, afro-futurism, and media theory to contextualize collective exploration. Students will be expected to create studio-based art for critique. No musical experience is required.


#### Objectives
- Incorporate sound and listening into studio practice
- Gain proficiency with audio recording, editing, and real-time synthesis technology and techniques
- Survey contemporary artists working with sound as a medium
- Consider contemporary culture through sound-based epistemologies


## Assignments and Grading

### Artist presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an artist working with sound as a primary medium. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show one or two artworks in detail. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTko878Fl9p0770zD9ozqkDBEx_74oQaFapaPRosaVo/edit#gid=0) on an artist chosen from [a list](https://github.com/brianhouse/ART327/blob/main/resources/sound_artists.md) on a first-come, first-served basis (you may present on an artist not from the list with prior approval). This presentation is 10% of your final grade.

### Exercises
Exercises are short assignments to help you get a handle on new techniques. In most cases, they are due for the class session following the one in which they are introduced. Cumulatively, they make up 10% of your final grade.

### Reading
Most classes will include discussion of short texts that address conceptual issues in sound art. You are required to read them before class and have questions and comments ready. Posting a short response (1-3 sentences) online before class begins will be worth 5% of your final grade (asking a question about something you didn't understand is an excellent use of a post).

### Participation
Grades will be given once in the middle of the semester and once at the end based on a subjective evaluation of in-class participation. Cumulatively, these are worth 25% your final grade.

### Projects
This course is built around four projects completed over the course of the semester and which will be [critiqued by the class](https://github.com/brianhouse/ART327/blob/main/resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to be experimental and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. A title and [3-sentence statement](https://github.com/brianhouse/ART327/blob/main/resources/statement_guidelines.md) must be included with each project. Cumulatively, the projects account for 50% of your final grade, with the final project given double weight. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.

### COVID-19 Alterations
This course will be primarily taught online for Spring 2020 to help safeguard our community. Note that students attending via Zoom must have their camera turned on (failure to do so will affect your participation grade). If you have an extenuating circumstance that affects your ability to have the camera turned on, email me and we will discuss. Office hours available online and in-person, by appointment.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Laptop Use
A personal laptop is required for some work for this course. Recent hardware and MacOS is preferred; Windows and Linux are also fine, Chromebooks will not work. If you do not have access to a laptop, email me and we will make arrangements for you to borrow a machine.

### Open Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are encouraged to work in Fields 205.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7192). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.  

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College's 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. The work submitted in Digital Media courses must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Land Acknowledgement
The Fields Art Center is built on land belonging to the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watalala bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya, and other indigenous nations of the Columbia River, and we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. Furthermore, we are at an institution named after white colonizers in a city with a racist history. As artists working with technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways our tools have been used to capitalize upon and perpetuate violence toward marginalized people.
