# Exercise: Non-Acoustic Vignette

Create a 20 second edited recording (equivalent to your [Acoustic Vignette](acoustic_vignette.md)), but this time use a contact microphone and/or an electromagnetic pickup coil.

Turn in an MP3 file on Moodle.


### Using an external mic with the DR-05X

The jack for an external mic is at the top of the DR-05X.

Note that both the contact mic and the coil are _mono_ signals. In order to hear the sounds in both ears while you are recording, select "MONO" under "Menu → REC SETTING → TYPE" on your recorder.
