# Exercise: Non-Acoustic Vignette

Create a 20 second edited recording (equivalent to your [Acoustic Vignette](acoustic_vignette.md)), but this time use a [contact microphone](../workshops/contact_mic/contact_mic.md) and/or an [inductor](../workshops/inductor/inductor/md).

Turn in an MP3 file on Moodle.
