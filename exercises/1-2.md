# Editing

Using your recording from the last exercise (or a new one if you prefer), create a 30 second edit. The new version should sound as though it were a seamlessly recorded sound, but it should be spliced together from the most interesting parts of your recording. Ideally, it should express the overall "character" and the salient events that you originally captured, but in condensed form.

Address clipping and distortion, the noise floor, normalization, and overall frequency response to create as clear and present a sound as possible.

Turn in a WAV file on Moodle.

If you need to, you can review lecture notes [here](../lectures/04_editing.md)
