# Exercise: Resonating Bodies

Using your amplifier + speaker and an audio player, experiment how different materials, surfaces, objects, and enclosures affect the sound that is produced. Find, make, or modify a particularly resonant or interesting sounding way to materially enhance a sound coming from your speaker and demonstrate it for the class.
