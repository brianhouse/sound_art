Using your amplifier, audio player, and a speaker, experiment how different materials, surfaces, objects, and enclosures affect the sound that is produced. Find, make, or modify a particularly resonant or interesting sounding way to materially enhance the sound from your amplifier; bring it in to demonstrate for the class.
