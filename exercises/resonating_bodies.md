# Exercise: Resonating Bodies

Using your amplifier, audio player, and one or two speakers and/or transducers, experiment how different materials, surfaces, objects, and enclosures affect the sound that is produced. Find or make a particularly resonant or interesting sounding way to materially enhance the sound from your amplifier; bring it in to demonstrate for the class.
