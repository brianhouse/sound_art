# Arranging

Once again using your recording from the last exercise (or a new one if you prefer), create a 10 second audio piece that utilizes layered audio clips, amplitude envelopes, stereo positioning and movement, and effects to create an immersive environment that is richer than the original recording.

Turn in an MP3 (320kbps, joint stereo) on Moodle, as well as a screenshot of your Audacity project while zoomed out to see all of the audio.
