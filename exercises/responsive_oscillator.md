# Exercise: Responsive Oscillator

Working alone or in pairs, build a custom synthesizer. Use it to give a short "performance" of some kind. This could mean manipulating it directly as a "musical" instrument, incorporating it into a costume or sculpture, or making an object that responds to its environment via light and/or touch. Extra points for making the strangest sound.
