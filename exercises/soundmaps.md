# Exercise: Soundmaps

For this exercise, you will visually represent your sonic environment.

You may choose any stationary location or walkable area: a room indoors, a spot in the forest, a path through campus, the grocery store, etc (but no virtual or online spaces).

Spend at least a half-hour in your site listening. Then, make a 2D map, score, diagram, or impression of its sounds. Pay attention to their sources, qualities, and effects.

Make a high quality scan, photograph, or export of your result. Turn it in via Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.

Some of the following are maps of sound in spaces; others are "graphic scores" intended to be performed by musicians or computers that might also serve the same purpose.
