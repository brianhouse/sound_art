get the mix 8, because it has a send, so there's more options for feedback etc


localization added to acoustics lecture (also phase)


statements should be sound art

// amherst class todos
make an instrument control setup
oled
motors

two esp setup is maybe better because it avoids wifi 
client server should be possible 

the trick is first, interface esp with PD, pref over serial
then network it with another one

mycropython over serial to pd

marcel: new control flow rhythm language? [could be in python opengl now!]

need lots of knobs-- how

///
where was I going with this? I think fabricating an interface to the sound

so that could be in a musical sense
...but also in terms of making an interactive installation

really need raspis or something


there are audio playback feathers
...but that's irrelevant with the tascams, unless they're going to be responsive
really I want pd on raspi. which does work, right?

maybe in the future I forget about Pd programming
also

so how would that work? does it need to be interactive?

better just to have microcontrollers making rhythms with motors or whatnot
