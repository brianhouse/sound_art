### Flow

For future, listen to all the exercises, but just play them all in a row without commentary or critique. If it's 1 minute, that's just 13 minutes. make them 30s, and you've got just 8 minutes. that's worth doing. can follow that with a few followups for students that have questions for other students.


#### Lectures

statements in crit examples should be sound art, not media art


#### Audacity

For those of you that still cannot load .m4a files into Audacity, you'll need to install the FFMPEG libraries for Mac (https://lame.buanzo.org/lame_64bit_osx.pkg) or PC (https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.zip). Do this and then restart Audacity, and the import should work. If not, let me know and we can work through it during office hours.



#### Pd

clip~ and distortion should come earlier

need to cover "delay" in sequencing. move it out of the live_input part

replace `dac~` with `output~` in synthesis lecture

emphasize `loadbang` earlier

missing help files for some objects

add comport install to sensors lecture


### new

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware. put this in the third section, make it all hardware based.

use hardware to have the "synth" section performative? could use a beringer or something. or could have interface building (knobs). if with wifi esp32s, could be wireless. go easy but that'd be sweet. using laser engraver would be next step. --> although I also like this being "hands off"

cut down on some of the synthesis stuff

don't need to have too much electronics otherwise, don't have time to learn cmos.
