MAKE SURE ADDING THE CLASS IN ADD/DROP REQUIRES PERMISSION


## Presentations

download material from student presentations; make sure I'm good on all the artists

go through Moodle to add the "slides such as Keynote" phrase


## Intro

can the intro be a way of teaching transduction, rather than listening? use bodies to make a recording system?

/

or, there chould be something more interesting about the size and nature of sound waves. could that be the hand-on workshop?



## Recording

without numbers, the graphics arent in order so it's a problem to show them -- number everything!

but regardless, this kind of sucked. it needs to be at the least a physical demonstration with a turntable. 

electromagnetism is so central, also, we need to see an electromagnet.

What is Audio! electrical signal that fluctuates in a way that is analogous to a sound wave â€” and which is then transferred into one (whether or not it originated as one)

digital? == measurements


==> should actually spend time to respond (not necessarily critique) the exercises (what are we hearing?)


### contact mics


add the preamp circuit for them?
https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2022/07/piezo-contact-microphone-preamp-for-plug-in-power/


show the images on the display as I go around

are there electrets? or no?


## Editing / Arranging

have a demo file for this! I did it without hearing anything, which was ridiculous

note the headphone quirk where it doesnt recognize the device

a chance to have mixing feedback is a bit important

importing multiple source files?

normalize on export


## Soundscape

move Ernst up to present same day as Cardiff, need a bit more for that class, and can add something else less crucial for understanding soundscapes (add diversity, as that isn't as necessary to understand in advance, pairs with the Robinson)


## Soldering

solder removal with those braided strips


## Amps + Speakers

DFPLayer? ---> for the first "resonating body" exercise, just have them use their recorders. _then_ we introduce DFPlayer.

need an image of the wires wrapped in the stereo plug prior to soldering

no one made a box for "resonating body". I think I should demonstrate this with a cardboard box.
