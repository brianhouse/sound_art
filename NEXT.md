### Flow


#### Lectures

statements in crit examples should be sound art, not media art


#### Audacity

For those of you that still cannot load .m4a files into Audacity, you'll need to install the FFMPEG libraries for Mac (https://lame.buanzo.org/lame_64bit_osx.pkg) or PC (https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.zip). Do this and then restart Audacity, and the import should work. If not, let me know and we can work through it during office hours.


#### Soundscape

what it becomes is an exercise in narrative, but we haven't prepped narrative at all. so either we do that, or the terms of the assignment have to change.

if this gets broken out to become a project in Sound + Space, make it a strict 3min _loop_ that's four channel, and start it at a random place. ie, narrative goes away.


#### Pd


missing help files for:
audioclip~
sampler~
peak~
pitch~
smoother
unsig~
mute~
piano
scope~

add comport install to sensors lecture



use line as a breakpoint, or breakpoints in general, for change over time
this is in sequencing

adsr over the audioclip to eliminate clips when selecting sections

textfile

udp


definitely use plugdata, I'm psyched. but have to change the name of output~ and figure out import paths, because it conflicts with cyclone and that is bundled

question in the course if we're putting this on raspi, it also has to work in vanilla, right?


plugdata issues to bring up on github:
- can I remove cyclone etc so we don't get into trouble?
- help files of external libraries

although maybe it's a question of having piopd as a proper library, I have to look into how to do that

definitely reinstall from whatever is on this machine

the fact that it works as a plugin with a DAW is very useful, is that part of the course?


### future v1

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware. put this in the third section, make it all hardware based.

use hardware to have the "synth" section performative? could use a beringer or something. or could have interface building (knobs). if with wifi esp32s, could be wireless. go easy but that'd be sweet. using laser engraver would be next step. --> although I also like this being "hands off"

cut down on some of the synthesis stuff

don't need to have too much electronics otherwise, don't have time to learn cmos.


### future 2

replace lectures with building activities. ie, make a turntable. make a spatial recording. etc. I should introduce an artist each time, but I think we can also skip the readings. get rid of synthesis and make it hardware.

- keep the soundmaps
- something about spatialization and ears -- get some hearing test equipment? hell yeah.
- then they build a turntable to learn about transduction (or skip to focus on tape?)
- then they build their own speakers and microphones (and coils, and piezos) -- (how feasible is real mics?)
- then they use magnetic tape to splice and layer (walkmans) -- diy reel to reel?
- speakers and feedback
- then we do some oscillators and shit from Nic Collins
- digital recording and audacity -- something about sampling/remixing etc, ie source material

do we ever use the recorders? or a computer?

this is "Sound as Material"

full set is speakers, mics, amps, transducers, tape and/or turntable
(ideally we can do this with batteries rather than wall power)
the cassette tape needs record and playback -- ideally separated from the housing
if these are a combined head ... can they be mounted separately? like can I get a line of playback heads?

(more on youtube)

build a sampler with short loops and old tapes (resetting the tape would be hard)


//

Pd stuff goes to Electronic Instruments
include breakpoint function / curve -- have to actually teach narrative, layers, depth if that's what I want in the results
amen break in a sampler

unfortunately, I think there's a question of whether Pd is going to work going forward, as it's very bugging on a few people's computers

this could all be in Max, but what a pain.
purrData?
https://plugdata.org ?

Hereâ€™s a good video about the Beasley piece:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-ANGQASKs
I show it to students sometimes



###

future format:

have a series of workshops introducing each material, with an exercise (or two) due for each one

have three or four projects stretching over the semester that have conceptual (but not material) briefs

have more artist presentations, but focus them on individual artworks (have a list of 30 artworks to pick from)

maybe limit the readings to a few in the beginning or end? or one per workshop? or have a student introduce a reading and have questions to lead discussion

interleave these things, with the idea that there is "free time" in class to be working with materials. (_could_ potentially then increase class time to 3 hrs)

ideally there is space in the studio for students to leave stuff (and then only one materials-based course a semester, making the other theory or code)

[as an aside, also need to get a monitor mounted for displaying work somewhere, whether downstairs or in the hall upstairs]

be very careful to avoid narrative



/

on the one hand, would be amazing for it to be 100% analog, close your computers
on the other, maybe playback triggering with feathers would be essential to a real situated sound assignment
