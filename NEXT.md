MAKE SURE ADDING THE CLASS IN ADD/DROP REQUIRES PERMISSION


## Intro

can the intro be a way of teaching transduction, rather than listening? use bodies to make a recording system?

/

or, there chould be something more interesting about the size and nature of sound waves. could that be the hand-on workshop?



## Recording

without numbers, the graphics arent in order so it's a problem to show them -- number everything!

but regardless, this kind of sucked. it needs to be at the least a physical demonstration with a turntable. 

electromagnetism is so central, also, we need to see an electromagnet.

What is Audio! electrical signal that fluctuates in a way that is analogous to a sound wave â€” and which is then transferred into one (whether or not it originated as one)

digital? == measurements


### contact mics

note the headphone quirk where it doesnt recognize the device

a chance to have mixing feedback is a bit important



## Soldering

solder removal with those braided strips
