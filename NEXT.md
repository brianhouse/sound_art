## Intro

can the intro be a way of teaching transduction, rather than listening? use bodies to make a recording system?

/

there should be something more interesting about the size and nature of sound waves. could that be the hand-on workshop?



## Recording

without numbers, the graphics arent in order so it's a problem to show them -- number everything!

but regardless, this kind of sucked. it needs to be at the least a physical demonstration with a turntable. 

electromagnetism is so central, also, we need to see an electromagnet.


## Editing / Arranging

have a demo file for this! I did it without hearing anything, which was ridiculous

note the headphone quirk where it doesnt recognize the device



## Soldering

solder removal with those braided strips
