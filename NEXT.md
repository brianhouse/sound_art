### Flow


#### Lectures

statements in crit examples should be sound art, not media art


#### Audacity

For those of you that still cannot load .m4a files into Audacity, you'll need to install the FFMPEG libraries for Mac (https://lame.buanzo.org/lame_64bit_osx.pkg) or PC (https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.zip). Do this and then restart Audacity, and the import should work. If not, let me know and we can work through it during office hours.


#### Soundscape

what it becomes is an exercise in narrative, but we haven't prepped narrative at all. so either we do that, or the terms of the assignment have to change.

if this gets broken out to become a project in Sound + Space, make it a strict 3min _loop_ that's four channel, and start it at a random place. ie, narrative goes away.

### future v1

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware. put this in the third section, make it all hardware based.

use hardware to have the "synth" section performative? could use a beringer or something. or could have interface building (knobs). if with wifi esp32s, could be wireless. go easy but that'd be sweet. using laser engraver would be next step. --> although I also like this being "hands off"

cut down on some of the synthesis stuff

don't need to have too much electronics otherwise, don't have time to learn cmos.


### future 2

replace lectures with building activities. ie, make a turntable. make a spatial recording. etc. I should introduce an artist each time, but I think we can also skip the readings. get rid of synthesis and make it hardware.

- keep the soundmaps
- something about spatialization and ears -- get some hearing test equipment? hell yeah.
- then they build a turntable to learn about transduction
- then they build their own microphones (and coils, and piezos) -- (how feasible is real mics?)
- then they use magnetic tape to splice and layer (walkmans)
- then we do some oscillators and shit from Nic Collins
- speakers and feedback
- digital recording and audacity -- something about sampling/remixing etc, ie source material

do we ever use the recorders? or a computer?

this is "Sound as Material"

Pd stuff goes to Electronic Instruments
include breakpoint function / curve
amen break in a sampler

unfortunately, I think there's a question of whether Pd is going to work going forward, as it's very bugging on a few people's computers

this could all be in Max, but what a pain.
