MAKE SURE ADDING THE CLASS IN ADD/DROP REQUIRES PERMISSION


chacon and french guy -- whoops I have two birds! take out chacon, this piece is not good.

add theremin?


## Readings

Make them official!

Fred Moten?

## Presentations

download material from student presentations; make sure I'm good on all the artists

go through Moodle to add the "slides such as Keynote" phrase


chavez was great, but what about Victoria Chen??

Christian Marclay? 


## Intro

can the intro be a way of teaching transduction, rather than listening? use bodies to make a recording system?

/

or, there chould be something more interesting about the size and nature of sound waves. could that be the hand-on workshop?



## Recording

without numbers, the graphics arent in order so it's a problem to show them -- number everything!

but regardless, this kind of sucked. it needs to be at the least a physical demonstration with a turntable. 

electromagnetism is so central, also, we need to see an electromagnet.

What is Audio! electrical signal that fluctuates in a way that is analogous to a sound wave â€” and which is then transferred into one (whether or not it originated as one)

digital? == measurements


==> should actually spend time to respond (not necessarily critique) the exercises (what are we hearing?)


### contact mics


add the preamp circuit for them?
https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2022/07/piezo-contact-microphone-preamp-for-plug-in-power/

show the images on the display as I go around

CAN WE DO SOMETHING WITH ELECTRETS?



## Editing / Arranging

have a demo file for this! I did it without hearing anything, which was ridiculous

note the headphone quirk where it doesnt recognize the device

a chance to have mixing feedback is a bit important

importing multiple source files?

normalize on export

images for Envelopes and Pannin


## Soundscape

move Ernst up to present same day as Cardiff, need a bit more for that class, and can add something else less crucial for understanding soundscapes (add diversity, as that isn't as necessary to understand in advance, pairs with the Robinson)


## Soldering

solder removal with those braided strips


## Amps + Speakers

DFPLayer? ---> for the first "resonating body" exercise, just have them use their recorders. _then_ we introduce DFPlayer for the assignment [hmm, maybe not time for that]

need an image of the wires wrapped in the stereo plug prior to soldering

no one made a box for "resonating body". I think I should demonstrate this with a cardboard box.

also, how transducers are used needs to be demonstrated

and maybe for that exercise we all use the same sound? eh.


### strategies that came up that I noted:
dampening
intimacy
directionality
frequency choice -- treble vs bass
personification
found objects 
movement
vibration of other moving
cymatocs 
different pitch resonates
signifying 
enclosures?
surface moving


## Laser Cutting

Add to tutorial:
- Inkscape segment deletion (make the nodes and then do control-double click)
- Images to the glowforge instructions

I actually wonder if laser cutting takes up too much time that could be used for electronics. not enough people are taking advantage of it anyway.


## Sound Objects

I am anticipated it really needs two full weeks, presenting on the following Monday
which implies that using a final exam period would really help open up the final project possibilities

didnt get a chance for proper desk crits (the other project either)


maybe there's just a midterm and a final



## flow

I'm wondering if bumping up the exercises a bit, include electronics along the way, and then having the Sound Object as the final. bump up the soundscape assignment a bit too, with added mics (so maybe push it back a bit). and eliminate laser cutting.

artist choices and readings are banging


and need desk crits!

crit for all exercises

yes, just midterm and final

workshop on switches
do a friday session on laser cutting



### more on circuits

https://eater.net/8bit

solenoids could really be key. but how does that integrate? and battery power?
