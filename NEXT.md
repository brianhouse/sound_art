## Intro



## Recording

ideally, replace this with building something.

electromagnetism is so central, we also need to see an electromagnet.


## Editing / Arranging

have a demo file for this! I did it without hearing anything, which was ridiculous

a chance to have mixing feedback is a bit important



## Amps + Speakers

no one made a box for "resonating body". I think I should demonstrate this with a cardboard box.

and maybe for that exercise we all use the same sound? eh.



### now

the flow diagrams are a little weird if the rail-breadboard is going to be used for mixing.

don't have the pot hanging over the edge in the diagram, they will copy that directly and make more fragile boards
