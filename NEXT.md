## Intro



## Recording

ideally, replace this with building something.

electromagnetism is so central, we need to see an electromagnet.


## Editing / Arranging

have a demo file for this! I did it without hearing anything, which was ridiculous

note the headphone quirk where it doesnt recognize the device

a chance to have mixing feedback is a bit important

importing multiple source files?

normalize on export

images for Envelopes and Panning


## Amps + Speakers

no one made a box for "resonating body". I think I should demonstrate this with a cardboard box.

also, how transducers are used needs to be demonstrated -- or skip them

and maybe for that exercise we all use the same sound? eh.


### strategies that came up that I noted:
dampening
intimacy
directionality
frequency choice -- treble vs bass
personification
found objects 
movement
vibration of other moving
cymatocs 
different pitch resonates
signifying 
enclosures?
surface moving



### now

the flow diagrams are a little weird if the rail-breadboard is going to be used for mixing.

don't have the pot hanging over the edge in the diagram, they will copy that directly and make more fragile boards
