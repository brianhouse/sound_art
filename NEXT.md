### fixes



#### Pd

clip~ and distortion should come earlier

need to cover "delay" in sequencing. move it out of the live_input part

replace `dac~` with `output~` in synthesis lecture

For future, listen to all the exercises, but just play them all in a row without commentary or critique. If it's 1 minute, that's just 13 minutes. make them 30s, and you've got just 8 minutes. that's worth doing. can follow that with a few followups for students that have questions for other students.

emphasize `loadbang` earlier

missing help files for some objects

add comport install to sensors lecture

For those of you that still cannot load .m4a files into Audacity, you'll need to install the FFMPEG libraries for Mac (https://lame.buanzo.org/lame_64bit_osx.pkg) or PC (https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.zip). Do this and then restart Audacity, and the import should work. If not, let me know and we can work through it during office hours.



### new

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware


use the beringer controls to have the "synth" section performative? or some other section?


### more

could have interface building (knobs). if with wifi esp32s, could be wireless

cut down on some of the synthesis stuff

and maybe tape manipulation with the field recordings

go easy but that'd be sweet. using laser engraver would be next step.

don't need to have too much electronics otherwise, don't have time to learn cmos.
