### Flow


#### Lectures

statements in crit examples should be sound art, not media art




#### Soundscape

what it becomes is an exercise in narrative, but we haven't prepped narrative at all. so either we do that, or the terms of the assignment have to change.

if this gets broken out to become a project in Sound + Space, make it a strict 3min _loop_ that's four channel, and start it at a random place. ie, narrative goes away.




### future v1

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware. put this in the third section, make it all hardware based.

use hardware to have the "synth" section performative? could use a beringer or something. or could have interface building (knobs). if with wifi esp32s, could be wireless. go easy but that'd be sweet. using laser engraver would be next step. --> although I also like this being "hands off"

cut down on some of the synthesis stuff

don't need to have too much electronics otherwise, don't have time to learn cmos.


### future 2

replace lectures with building activities. ie, make a turntable. make a spatial recording. etc. I should introduce an artist each time, but I think we can also skip the readings. get rid of synthesis and make it hardware.

- keep the soundmaps
- something about spatialization and ears -- get some hearing test equipment? hell yeah.
- then they build a turntable to learn about transduction (or skip to focus on tape?)
- then they build their own speakers and microphones (and coils, and piezos) -- (how feasible is real mics?)
- then they use magnetic tape to splice and layer (walkmans) -- diy reel to reel?
- speakers and feedback
- then we do some oscillators and shit from Nic Collins
- digital recording and audacity -- something about sampling/remixing etc, ie source material

do we ever use the recorders? or a computer?

this is "Sound as Material"

full set is speakers, mics, amps, transducers, tape and/or turntable
(ideally we can do this with batteries rather than wall power)
the cassette tape needs record and playback -- ideally separated from the housing
if these are a combined head ... can they be mounted separately? like can I get a line of playback heads?

(more on youtube)

build a sampler with short loops and old tapes (resetting the tape would be hard)

Hereâ€™s a good video about the Beasley piece:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-ANGQASKs
I show it to students sometimes



###

future format:

have a series of workshops introducing each material, with an exercise (or two) due for each one

have three or four projects stretching over the semester that have conceptual (but not material) briefs

have more artist presentations, but focus them on individual artworks (have a list of 30 artworks to pick from)

maybe limit the readings to a few in the beginning or end? or one per workshop? or have a student introduce a reading and have questions to lead discussion

interleave these things, with the idea that there is "free time" in class to be working with materials. (_could_ potentially then increase class time to 3 hrs)

ideally there is space in the studio for students to leave stuff (and then only one materials-based course a semester, making the other theory or code)

[as an aside, also need to get a monitor mounted for displaying work somewhere, whether downstairs or in the hall upstairs]

be very careful to avoid narrative



/

on the one hand, would be amazing for it to be 100% analog, close your computers
on the other, maybe playback triggering with feathers would be essential to a real situated sound assignment



/

making enclosures out of boxes would be great just on its own

seriously, this is almost essential. but not just boxes, get a found object. field trip to the bins? oh wait, that's portland.

/

a "sound sculpture" (or even just a box that opens) is great project

an object, an installation, a track, a performance -- these really broad categories could be useful

working with servos is not at all incidental. the speaker is one thing, transducers are another, actuators are a third

sensors also relevant. presence, sound level, that's about it.

assignment: bring in an object and activate it


/

a blindfolded exercise, for navigating by sound
(better for sound + space?)

/

thinking "Sound Art" might stay. Sound as Material is weirder.


/

really have to do a whole unit on documentation

tripods, man. and how to sync. digital tools for documentation, for sure.

need to get lights. not spots, but those even LED things.

--> the point is excellent work in my student portfolio


fyi, sterne's syllabi are online


tone generator / filters



//////


units/workshops:

- deep listening (oliveros) in class
- soundscape maps (schafer) as homework, or maybe first assignment?
- audiometers

- digital recorders + editing in audacity (DR-05X)

# materials with which to make sound art objects
- piezos (vitiello)  -- build our own (DR-05X)
- pickups (kubisch)  -- build our own (DR-05X) https://www.instructables.com/Make-A-Guitar-Pickup/
- transducers (tudor) -- build our own (DR-05X)
- solenoids and motors (zimoun) -- buy, need arduinos also? https://www.instructables.com/Controlling-solenoids-with-arduino/
- + sensor
- oscillators

- laser cutter

- tape loops (basinski? portland guy?)
- speakers + enclosures  -- transform a found object? or is this covered by transducers?

//

- binaural / headphones (cardiff)
- cymatics

can be an artist reading with each one

I think three big projects, is there a brief, or no?

going to need small amps
