## Intro

can the intro be a way of teaching transduction, rather than listening? use bodies to make a recording system?

/

or, there chould be something more interesting about the size and nature of sound waves. could that be the hand-on workshop?



## Recording

without numbers, the graphics arent in order so it's a problem to show them -- number everything!

but regardless, this kind of sucked. it needs to be at the least a physical demonstration with a turntable. 

electromagnetism is so central, also, we need to see an electromagnet.

What is Audio! electrical signal that fluctuates in a way that is analogous to a sound wave â€” and which is then transferred into one (whether or not it originated as one)

digital? == measurements


==> should actually spend time to respond (not necessarily critique) the exercises (what are we hearing?)



## Editing / Arranging

have a demo file for this! I did it without hearing anything, which was ridiculous

note the headphone quirk where it doesnt recognize the device

a chance to have mixing feedback is a bit important

importing multiple source files?

normalize on export

## Amps + Speakers

no one made a box for "resonating body". I think I should demonstrate this with a cardboard box.

also, how transducers are used needs to be demonstrated -- or skip them

and maybe for that exercise we all use the same sound? eh.


### strategies that came up that I noted:
dampening
intimacy
directionality
frequency choice -- treble vs bass
personification
found objects 
movement
vibration of other moving
cymatocs 
different pitch resonates
signifying 
enclosures?
surface moving



### now

the flow diagrams are a little weird if the rail-breadboard is going to be used for mixing.

don't have the pot hanging over the edge in the diagram, they will copy that directly and make more fragile boards
