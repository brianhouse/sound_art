# Contact Microphones

### Materials
- Piezo element
- 1/8" TS (mono) audio cable
- Electrical Tape
- Can of Plasti-Dip
- Tack

### Tools
- Coarse wire strippers (yellow band)
- Fine wire strippers (red band)
- Soldering stations (w/ smoke extractors and "helping hands")
- Scissors

## Instructions
1. Cut the audio cable in half (share with your partner).

1. Using the coarse wire strippers (yellow band) strip 2" off the outer insulation (use the third largest hole on the strippers). Be gentle, because you don't want to damage what's inside. If you do, just make a clean cut and start over.

1. Twist the strands of the outer shielding together to form a wire.

1. Remove the inner shielding (twisting it back and forth can help get it loose) and cut it off with the strippers.

1. Strip .5" off the inner insulation using the fine wire strippers (red band, second to largest hole), and twist those strands together.

1. If necessary, use the fine strippers (red band) to strip .5" of insulation off of the piezo leads (use the third smallest hole). Be very careful not to pull the leads off of the disc—do not pull on the disc itself).

1. Twist the strands of each end of the piezo leads together.

1. Now, wrap the end of the red piezo wire together with the inner wire of the cable. Take care with this step to make it as clean and tight as possible. I begin by crossing the leads at right angles and then turning them around each other.

1. Do the same with the black wire on the piezo and the outer wire on the cable.

1. [Solder](../soldering/soldering.md) both of these joints together.

1. Turn the soldering station off.
1. Wrap a small piece of electrical tape around both joints so that no bare wire is showing.

1. Coil the piezo wire so that it fits on top of the disc, and tape it with a piece of electrical tape. Trim the tape if necessary.

1. Briefly submerge the piezo in Plasti-Dip so it coats everything up to the cable insulation. Hang and allow to dry overnight.



## Use

Your contact mic may be used as an external input to the DR-05X via the jack at the top of the unit between the built-in mics.

The contact mic is just a single signal, so you'll want to switch to "MONO" under "Menu → REC SETTING → TYPE" on your recorder (remember to switch it back if you're going to return to the built-in mics!).

From there, all the same recording procedures apply.

However, note that contact mics can produce a very "hot"—ie, loud—signal, which can easily clip and be harmful to your ears. Always **start with low gain** to avoid this.

### Tack

Contact mics work best when they are directly attached to something. Sticky tack works well for this.


## How it works

The [piezoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity) is a property of some materials to respond mechanically to electricity, or vice versa. In this case, a small ceramic disc is glued to a larger metal one—when it bends, it produces an electrical signal analogous to its movement. In this respect, it is a transducer, just like a diaphragm-based microphone, but only vibration through solid materials will make it move enough to produce a signal.
