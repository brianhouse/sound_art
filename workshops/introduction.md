# Introduction


## Introductions
- Name / pronouns / favorite sound from a machine

## Exercise
- [0.md](../exercises/0.md)

## lecture-ish
- The exercise leads to a more fundamental question, which is, what is sound?
- (Some version of, "movement that we can hear")

- What is studio art?

- So what is sound art?
    - not one thing
    - _music_ is a really specialized and highly developed cultural discourse: you have rhythm and harmony, instruments and scores, clubs and concert halls, records, streaming services, genres and subgenres, etc etc
    - technically speaking, music is undoubtedly sound art, but we're going to deemphasize all of those things that make music what it is
    - it's back to basics, more or less, when we start thinking about sound as a material for art making
    - that's not to say there is not a cultural context for doing this, because there is a rich one
    - it's often experimental musicians who have taken this approach, but it's also anthropologists, computer scientists, and studio artists

- So what is Sound Art as in this specific class at Amherst?
    - more or less three sections to how we're going to approach things: the first is working with field recordings, the second is digital synthesis, and the third is situating sound in physical space, which are really three interrelated modes of sound art practice
    - all of you hopefully have a sense of studio practice, and this will be a project-based and crit-based course
    - I am however going to be teaching some basic skills in digital audio
    - there will also be an emphasis on reading and discussion

Questions before we get into the syllabus?

## Moodle + Syllabus
- Moodle used primarily to collect assignments
- If you go to that now, we'll look at the syllabus
- If you notice, this is a link to Github, which is a coding platform that I use to manage all my materials. This is the definitive schedule that has links to all the exercises and projects.


## For next class
- Everyone sign up for a date to present
- Read the Oliveros piece and leave a response
