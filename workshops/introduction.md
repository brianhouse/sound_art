Questions before we get into the syllabus?

## Moodle + Syllabus
- Moodle used primarily to collect assignments, you'll need the syllabus for the schedule
- If you go to that now, we'll look at the syllabus
- If you notice, this is a link to Github, which is a coding platform that I use to manage all my materials. This is the definitive schedule that has links to all the exercises and projects.
