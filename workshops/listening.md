# Introductory Exercise

### Preparing
You'll need a paper and something to write with.

### Listening
For five minutes, write down every sound you can hear. Put each one on a new line, because we'll need some room.

### Reporting
- Everyone go around in a circle saying sounds until there are no more sounds.
- Note any sounds other people heard that you may have missed, and add them to your list.

### Reflecting
- What are some categories for these sounds' sources?

<!-- 
- Do this on a whiteboard:
    - Inside your own body
    - Your body moving other things
    - Other peoples' bodies
    - Other peoples' bodies moving things
    - Machines moving on their own
        - Climate control
        - Vehicles
    - Nonhuman living things
    - Weather
        - Wind
        - Precipitation
    - Earth itself (hope not!)
    - —> annotate your sound list according to these categories
-->

- What are some categories, or perhaps binaries or continuums, for the _qualities_ of these sounds?
<!--
    - Loud <-> soft
    - Pitched <-> unpitched
    - High pitch <-> low pitch
    - Rough <-> pure
    - Sharp, watery, diffuse, clanky, etc
    - Discrete / repeating / continuous
        - Repeating fast <-> slow
        - Repeating randomly <-> rhythmically
    - Close <-> distant
    - Moving <-> still
    - Reverberant <-> dry (depends on your space)
    - –> annotate your sound list with these qualities
-->

- What are some of the subjective ways in which we might react to these sounds?
<!--
    - Familiar / unfamiliar
        - Familiar from general experience
        - Familiar from particular memories
    - Concerning / benign
    - Background / foreground
    - Relaxing <-> exciting / depressing <-> irritating
    - –> annotate your sound list with how you feel about the sounds 
-->

### Reconsidering
- Pick a couple of these categories/continuums from each of the types that you think are most interesting.
- Annotate your observations.

### Synthesizing
Listen again, for two more minutes. Confirm your auditions.

### A Step Back
- The exercise leads to a more fundamental question, which is, what is sound?
<!-- (Some version of, "movement that we can hear") -->
