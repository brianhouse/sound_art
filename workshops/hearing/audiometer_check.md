# Audiometer Operational Listening Check

The object of the listening check (also called a functional check) of the audiometer is to verify that the unit is functioning properly and that the test signals are being generated and routed to the appropriate earphone without distortion, extraneous sounds (such as clicks or hum), or loss of signal.                        

_NOTE: Technicians must be able to hear with thresholds better than or equal to 25 dB HL from 500-8000 Hz bilaterally to conduct the audiometer listening check._
                                        
There are five components to the functional check - listening to the quality of the test tones, verifying the adjustment of the attenuator, checking the integrity of the earphone cords, checking the function of the response switch, and ensuring the proper routing of signals between the right and left earphones. The listening check is conducted as described below.

1. Turn on the audiometer and allow it to warm up for at least 3 minutes
2. Verify that the headphone jacks are correctly inserted into their respective ports
3. Set Tone mode to PULSED
4. Switch output to RIGHT ear 
5. Check tonal quality:
   1. Set the frequency to 500 Hz and adjust the dB knob to a level of 50 dB. Hold the center blue TONE pad. Listen to the tone pulses; verify that the tones are clear and that there is no noticeable click at the beginning or end of each pulse.
   2. Cycle through all frequencies, listening briefly (about three pulses) to each to verify that the tones are not distorted and that there are no extraneous sounds.
   3. Select the LEFT ear, readjust the left attenuator to a level of 50 dB HL, and repeat the procedure.
6. Check the accuracy of the dB control:
   1. Select a test frequency of 1000 Hz and adjust the dB dial to 0 dB.
   2. Hold the TONE pad and adjust the dB dial slowly in 5 dB steps up to 70 dB HL, stopping briefly at each level to verify the intensity change and listening for any extraneous sounds (clicks, scratches, etc.) as the level is changed. NOTE: It is only necessary to conduct the attenuator check in one ear.
7. Check the earphone cords: 
   1. Select a test frequency of 1000 Hz and adjust the dB dial to 50 dB. Change the TONE MODE to NORM ON, hold the TONE pad button once to turn off the pulsing (there should now be a steady tone). 
   2. Switch output to RIGHT ear 
   3. Wiggle the earphone cords, especially where they enter the headphones and where they are plugged into the jacks inside the test room. Listen for any interruption in the test signal, changes in the signal level, or static or other noise in the headphones as the cords are flexed.
   4. Select the LEFT ear, readjust the intensity to 5 dB HL, and repeat the procedure.
8. Check the response switch:
   1.  Press the response button. Verify that the response light on the audiometer is activated as the button is pressed and that pressing the response switch does not produce any sound in the earphones.
9.  Check for crossover:
   1. Unplug the right earphone jack from the back of the audiometer.
   2. Select the RIGHT headphone, adjust the dB dial to 70 dB HL, set the test frequency to 1000 Hz, and press the TONE pad for a few seconds. Listen through the headphones; there should be no signal in either ear.
   3. Plug the right earphone jack back into the audiometer and unplug the left jack.
   4. Select the LEFT headphone, adjust the dB dial to 70 dB HL, and press the TONE SWITCH for a few seconds. Listen through the headphones; there should be no signal in either ear.
   5. Plug the left earphone jack back into the audiometer.
