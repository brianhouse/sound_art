## Synthesis

As we have explored, sound is a phenomena that relates perception, vibration, space, and meaning. So far, working with sound has meant listening and recording acoustic signals. To do that, we've also touched eletrical analog audio by assembling microphones, speakers, and amplifiers, and even manipulated things digitally. But sound has always begun with physical movement. 

However, there is another fundamental way in which sound is understood in relation to technology, and that is to create sound directly with electronics, either analog or digital. This is called synthesis. Rather than approach things using the fanciest digital signal processing software on our laptops, we will explore this using the foundational circuitry used in hardware synthesizer design. 


## Preparation

To make a synth, we will still need an amplifier + speaker like we've used before. The difference is that instead of an audio input jack, we will be wiring in our circuit directly. 

Position an amplifier breakout board at the right end of a large breadboard. We'll wire it to a power rail, and also bridge the two power rails so that we have + and - across the whole breadboard. Plug in a JST breakout somewhere on the rail (making sure to align + and -) use this to plug in a 3xAA battery pack.

We will also need a speaker. For our purposes at the moment, just one. L

I think flip everything over so positive can be on top and the power coming in on the left

The **V**oltage **C**ontrolled **O**scillator is one of the most basic components of a synth. At one time, it was made with vacuum tubes or individual transistors; now, it comes as an IC (**I**ntegrated **C**ircuit) chip. We will be using the CMOS 4046, which looks like this:
