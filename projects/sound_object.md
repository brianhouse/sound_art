# Sound Object

For this project, you will create an artwork that makes sound. The theme and concept of the piece are up to you, within a few constraints:
- The object must be freestanding, in that speakers/transducers, amplifier, batteries, and a playback device are enclosed within or otherwise a part of the object itself.
- The sound produced by the object should be continuous (looping) and specifically made for the piece. 
- The nature of the sound and the design of the object must meaningfully relate to each other.


### Proposal

Prior to beginning with the project, you will turn in a proposal, which should be organized in slides and exported to PDF format. It should include:
- your preliminary concept and any relevant illustrative material
- how it relates to (sound) art discourse
- how it relates to your studio practice / personal interests
- how you will build it and what materials and tools you are planning on using
- any technical or conceptual questions that you will need to solve
- questions that you have for the class about your project

Upload this proposal to Moodle under the section for this project. We will discuss these proposals in class.


### Documentation

In addition to presenting your artwork itself for critique in class, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short [documentation video](../workshops/documentation/documentation.md). These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.
