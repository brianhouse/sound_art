# Soundscapes

Choose a "site" (whether this is a physical location, an activity, a set of objects, a concept, etc), listen to it, and record its sounds. Produce a stereo audio experience that interprets these materials for a listener. Both your site selection and arrangement should express your philosophy of sound, which might incorporate concepts like soundmarks, schizophonia, and musique concret or be entirely your own.

Your piece must have a title and a [3-sentence artist statement](../resources/statement_guidelines.md) that articulates your approach.

You must exclusively use your own recordings and use Audacity to edit and arrange them. The final piece should be between 3 and 5 minutes long. Upload your final piece as a 320kbps MP3.
