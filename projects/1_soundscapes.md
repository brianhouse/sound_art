# Soundscapes

Choose a "site" (whether this is a physical location, an activity, a set of objects, a concept, etc), listen to it, and record its sounds. Produce a stereo audio experience that interprets these materials for a listener. Both your site selection and arrangement should express your philosophy of sound, which might incorporate concepts like soundmarks, schizophonia, and musique concret or be entirely your own.

Your piece must have a title and a [3-sentence artist statement](../resources/statement_guidelines.md) that articulates your approach. Prior to the project due date, you will turn in a proposal. This should consist of a draft artist statement along with a discussion of how you intend to accomplish the piece (recording practicalities, audio editing techniques used, etc). Submit this in the text box on Moodle for the Soundscapes project.

You must exclusively use your own recordings and use Audacity to edit and arrange them. The final piece should be between 3 and 5 minutes long. Upload your final piece as a 320kbps MP3 by resubmitting the project assignment.
