# Soundscapes

Choose a "site" (whether this is a physical location, an activity, a set of objects, a concept, etc), listen to it, and record its sounds. Produce a stereo audio experience that interprets these materials for a listener. Your piece must have a title. Prior to the project due date, you will turn in a proposal (see below) to Moodle.

You must exclusively use your own recordings and use Audacity to edit and arrange them. The final piece should be between 3 and 5 minutes long. Upload your final piece to Moodle a 320kbps MP3 by resubitting the assignment in Moodle.

### Proposal

Prior to beginning with the project, you will turn in a proposal that includes:
- your preliminary concept and any relevant illustrative material
- how it relates to (sound) art discourse
- how it relates to your studio practice
- any technical or conceptual questions that you will need to solve

We will discuss these proposals in class.
