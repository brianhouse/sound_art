# Soundmaps

For this project, you will visually represent your sonic environment.

You may choose any stationary location or walkable area: a room indoors, a spot in the forest, a path through campus, the grocery store, etc (but no virtual or online spaces).

Spend at least a half-hour in your site listening. Then, make a 2D map, score, diagram, or impression of its sounds. Pay attention to their sources, qualities, and effects.

Make a high quality scan, photograph, or export of your result. Turn it in via Google Classroom and be prepared to be share it over Zoom.
