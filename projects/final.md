# Final Project

Your final project is to create an artwork that utilizes sound and engages in sound art discourse in some way. You may use any or none of the techniques discussed in class, as long as the work shows rigorous conceptual and aesthetic development. It should connect to your studio practice and take on a topic of personal artistic concern which you should articulate in your description.


### Proposal

Prior to beginning with the project, you will turn in a proposal, which should be organized in slides and exported to PDF format. It should include:
- your preliminary concept and any relevant illustrative material
- how it relates to (sound) art discourse
- how it relates to your studio practice / personal interests
- how you will build it and what materials and tools you are planning on using
- any technical or conceptual questions that you will need to solve
- questions that you have for the class about your project

Upload this proposal to Moodle under the section for this project. We will discuss these proposals in class.


### Documentation

In addition to presenting your artwork itself for critique in class, the final deliverable for your project will consist of a title, 3-sentence artist description, and a short documentation video. These should be uploaded to Moodle prior to the crit.

Your video should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape**, [use AE/AF Lock](https://improvephotography.com/53127/what-is-ae-af-lock-on-an-iphone-and-how-does-that-help-my-pictures/), and use a tripod. Make use of the photo both in the back of 303. You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—just show your piece doing its thing.
