# Final Project

Your final project is to create an artwork that utilizes sound and engages in sound art discourse in some way. You may use any or none of the techniques discussed in class, as long as the work shows rigorous conceptual and aesthetic development. The work may be an audio piece, video work, installation, or other form. It should connect to your studio practice and take on a topic of personal artistic concern.

### Proposal

You will turn in a proposal that includes:
- your preliminary concept and any relevant illustrative material
- how it relates to (sound) art discourse
- how it relates to your studio practice
- the materials you anticipate using (Pd, speakers, recorder; wood, projection, paper-mach√©; found objects etc)
- technical questions that you will need to solve
- how you would like to present the work (gallery, site-specific installation, audio piece, video, etc)
- how you plan on documenting the work


### Documentation

Documentation of your work will be a part of your final grade; all projects should be presentable online in a form that can be a part of a web-based portfolio.


### Schedule

We will have a preliminary critique one week (after your proposal is due, and a final critique during our exam time. Issues raised in the preliminary critique should be addressed in some way by the final. Depending on the nature of the proposals, we will organize a means of experiencing the works as intended. Documentation is due by the end of the exam period.
