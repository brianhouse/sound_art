# Brian Eno

[Music for Airports, 2/2](swinsian)

this track is all ARP 2600

So Brian Eno (English, 1948) is one of the giants of late 20th-century music, both as a producer and as an experimental artist. If you don't know him already, you've read the bio in the article, which I won't repeat.

...but one detail I'll add is Eno composed the startup sound for Windows, so every time PC users turned on their computers, they would hear an Eno composition. And the hilarious thing is that he made it on a Mac.

I think the significance of Eno is that even though he is all over popular music, he is not a "musician" per se. He's virtuosic using studio technologies, not instruments, and he normalized the idea of the producer being a creative agent.

Parallels between Ambient Music and Schafer's notion of acoustic design? (is it a soundscape?)

How does this play into synthesis in the sense of "artificiality"?

Site specific sound, sound composed for particular types of activities and mental states ... that's always been what recorded music is used for, so here he takes it on explicitly

as a mental exercise, what physical locations, activities, or mental states that you would compose something for? and what would it sound like?
