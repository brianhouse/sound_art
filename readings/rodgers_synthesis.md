Born early 1970s
- Electronic musician also known for her scholarship, which takes a feminist approach to media theory and history
- MFA in electronic music from Mills College (which we learned about)
- PhD from McGill (Jonathan Sterne, quoted)
- pushed back against a masculinist culture in electronic music production by sharing resources, running workshops, co-creating histories
- doesn't use Pd, but SuperCollider, which is text-based


/

- Synthesis associated with synthetic / in opposition to natural
    - both positive (_better_ than nature, _queer_) and negative (cheap imitation) and complicated (transcending the body)

- Synthesis associated with _analysis_, breaking down into fundamental parts and functions, objective and observable
    - ...vs some unpredictable, nonhuman agency

- Cybernetics
    - what is that?
    - Post WWII "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine" (1948)
    - systems that incorporate human and non-human elements -> computers
    - the idea that you can define the world as a system

Andrew:
artifice and Plato

autotune

Elias:



Colin and John W:
objective analysis synthesis, Hemholtz vs Rylan (or any custom synth designer) emphasizes experience [ie, parameters are not named "filter", but are qualitative, not based on understanding the function] --> John, prescriptivist vs descriptivist

John Carr:
[physical synthesis]

Kamala:
interesting that sound can represent an ideology or identity

Misha:
hierarchies of materials and processes
cool idea about echo being no longer alive (Lee Scratch Perry)
