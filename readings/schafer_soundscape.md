# Murray Schafer

[Murray Schafer video](media/schafer.mp4)

Born 1933
- An enormously influential Canadian composer, music educator, and writer inexorably connected with the concept of the soundscape
- He incorporated environmental sounds and noises into traditional compositions and used graphic scores (musical scores that can have wildly different forms that are up for interpretation), and developed an alternative approach to music education with warmup exercises like "ear cleaning" (more or less what we did the first day)
- At Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, he founded the World Soundscape Project, an organization with the goal of documenting soundscapes
- His writings, particularly the book of which we just read the intro, inspired the development of the field of _acoustic ecology_
- Other practitioners associated with the origins of acoustic ecology include Barry Truax (computer musician known for developing real-time granular synthesis), Hildegard Westerkamp (who we'll hear from), and Bernie Krause (particularly the biophony)
- Interrelation between geophysical, biological, anthropogenic sounds
- Gave rise to the concept of "noise pollution" and intersects with environmentalism and environmental justice


The Soundscape

"What is the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change?"

A special quality of the ear that there are no earlids, so we are constantly bombarded or enveloped in the soundscape.

What is noise?
- "noises are the sounds we have learned to ignore"

Doesn't think we should just block out sound, wear ear plugs, etc. What's he advocating for instead?
- "acoustic design"

He compares this to what artistic movement?
- Bauhaus (1920s Germany, forced to close by the Nazis)
- "design" as a discipline integrating art, craft, and industrial production for everyday use
- [Bauhaus Aesthetic](https://www.google.com/search?q=bauhaus+aesthetic&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRpcmhra7uAhXoHDQIHfy9DkMQ_AUoAXoECBQQAw&biw=1206&bih=650)
- modernism

What are values associated with modernism, in art and in philosophy?
- ethic of elegant problem solving
- complete knowledge
- science
- rationalism
- in art: László Moholy-Nagy

Apollonian vs Dionysian sound
- rational vs emotional
- he's clearly on the side of Apollonian

What is orchestration in a classical music context?
- how you spread musical material across all the instruments of an orchestra; how they relate to one another
- this is more or less a top-down approach

There's a reactionary aspect to this
- god was sound / vibration -> became an image
- harmony as mysticism
- (colonial overtones via ethnomusicology, the sense of the spiritual "other")

Marshall McLuhan—back to the ear in an electronic society
- means this literally, with transmission, but also how connectivity works
- "Terror is the normal state of any oral society for in it everything affects everything all the time."
- twitter etc "speech", and as an aural medium


Schafer's vocabulary
- clairaudience: "clear (or clean) hearing"
- earwitness: describing sound from experience
/
- keynote sounds: background character of a place, unconscious (geophysical and animal in particular)
- signals: foreground, figure, conscious. coded, anthropocentric
- soundmarks: singular sounds of a place


Schizophonia
- when a sound is separated from its source
- recordings
- calls into question Sound in the age of mechanical reproduction (does it lose its aura? do we have to construct an apparatus around the aura?)

Zach, Golden Record
Jack, "Perhaps, he means that if we paid more attention to these sounds, we would take action to remove them from our soundscape environments?"
