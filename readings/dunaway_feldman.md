# Sound Art 1979 and Soundings 2013

I chose these because they are both artists commenting on the ways in which Sound Art has been brought to the institution, in this case MoMA, more or less the preeminent American museum, and by the same curator, Barbara London

who was really the first multimedia curator at that level, of both sound and video --- legitimizing those ways of working. 

...although not the last. I would say Paula Antonelli in the design department actually has a far more nuanced and less scene-based approach when it comes to technology

but curation does guide the canon in important ways

affordability of technology as a vehicle that allowed women to circumvent the system.

In the Sound Art exhibition, Barbara London stakes out three main tributaries of the large and murky flow of what was then and has since then been called “sound art”: 

(1) sound sculpture/installation via the visual art tradition, often with music used only as a component in a larger examination of sound,
(2) multispeaker sound installation via the academic music tradition, as a way to create an immersive sound experience outside the concert hall,
(3) performance presented in a visual arts context with a focus on sound, such as sound poetry, sound performance, and various multimedia forms.

Women excluded due to "emotional" and "musical" content, but this is actually hijacking mainstream audio forms

George Lewis's take on Cage's Silence — abstraction actually brackets history and the acoustic ecology of everyday life (that is raced, classed, etc)


### Feldman

"the longing towards commodities is part of the reason that the show leaned so heavily on the physicality of sound." ... rather than relationality

Tcherepnin’s work (transduced subway bench)
"It facilitated a kind of physical intimacy between people and things, evoking the possibility of queering hearing: of perceiving sound and feeling intimacies in non- normative spots and sites, subverting public structures for private pleasure. It would be easy to move from this physical experience to a more social or political proposition about the vibratory, pervasive nature of being "

sympathetic vibration (vs ethics)
we feel it rather than trying to understand it  

emphasizes sympathetic vibrations because it preserves the self, rather than having to understand the other


7 Brandon W. Joseph, in his review of this show in Artforum, points to this quality in the discourse around sound and music. He writes, “... sound art’s emotional impact is often understood to influence recipients without the intercession of social, historical, critical, or artistic knowledge. (This fantasy of unalloyed affectivity is itself a long-standing trope in the reception of music.)”

how does speech resist commodification?

Michael-- sound in a gallery is an attempt to legitimize it ["art" is a cultural context]

Zander-- sound art as hard to sell; ownership and currency in the gallery

Kess-- everything is site-specific

Wallent-- death of the author, Barthes (bart), it's the participation of the audience in the work

Elias--- the "objectness" of sound


Ann and Elias-- binarism in the Dunaway writing
