# Introduction to Sound Art

## electrets

what is the response range? could they actually work for infrasound/ultrasound?? that would be a whole unit.


## circuits

volume knob is key for controlling feedback

sensors is going to be key. photocells is one. what else? FSRs. conductiveness. temperature even? it's a variable resistor.

so basically, have an oscillator that responds to stimulus and/or knobs. (preferrably a VCO -- wait, does that work? VCO vs RCO)

ideally, sequence it


## future

- replace CMOS with sequenced solenoids + motors (ie, kinetics)
- replace the tascam with electret mics and tape loops



### tape players

this has a mic input:

this is also ideal:

## other options

- radios
- circuit bending
- more acoustic -- like build a pipe organ

reading:
- feld
- moten


## what's left out

music. composition. internal structure. and/or sonification and data manipulation. this _is_ really "materiality of sound" as much as possible: recording and digital editing, amplification and speakers, electronic synthesis (pushing the recording off the computer would complete that)
